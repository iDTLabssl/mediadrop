If you are updating from a newer version than those listed here,
you may simply run this:

	cd mediacore_install/
	paster setup-app deployment.ini

This will run all the pending migrations necessary to bring your
database up-to-date.

These scripts are required only because we had not set up
sqlalchemy-migrate at the time of these releases.
